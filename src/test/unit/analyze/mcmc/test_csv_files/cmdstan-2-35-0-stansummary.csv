# Inference for Stan model: bernoulli_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(1000,1000,1000,1000); warmup=(0,0,0,0); thin=(1,1,1,1); 4000 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took (0.0030, 0.0030, 0.0040, 0.0030) seconds, 0.013 seconds total
# Sampling took (0.0090, 0.010, 0.010, 0.0090) seconds, 0.038 seconds total
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
